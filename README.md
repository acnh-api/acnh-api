# ACNH API

This is a REST API for programmatic access to Dodo Codes and Custom Designs. My instance is available at:
- https://acnh-api.ashitty.website
- http://acnhok4pb2e6jwy2khjollqznnkrqxpt5toaknjrqdfeqir3iqhyl6ad.onion/

## Endpoints

### Dodo Codes

- /host-session/:dodo-code
Returns info about an active island hosting session.

### Custom Designs

The /design endpoints take an optional `scale` query parameter, an integer 1â€“6 which scales the image
using what is believed to be the same algorithm that the game uses.

- /design/:custom-design-code
Returns the unprocessed response from Nintendo's servers. Contains the raw data for the image along with its palette
and creator information. Binary data (`resp.mData.mData`) is base64 encoded.
- /design/:custom-design-code.tar
Returns a tar archive containing a PNG render of each layer of the given custom design code.
- /design/:custom-design-code/:layer.png
Returns a PNG render of the specified layer.
- /designs/:creator-id Lists the designs posted by the given creator ID. Query parameters:
  - pro: true/false. whether to list the creator's Pro designs only. If false only normal designs will be listed.
  - offset: 0-80. What offset to use.
  - For now, the limit is hardcoded to 40 to emulate a Switch and reduce ban risk. Later this restriction may be lifted.
  - The offset is also rounded down to the nearest Cmultiple of 40 for the same reason.
  - Pass offset=40 to get the next page, or offset=80 to get page 3. There is no page 4.

## Setup

First copy config.example.toml to config.toml. Now you will need a lot of information from your Switch
and eShop obtained copy of Animal Crossing: New Horizons.
If you're buying the game just for this API, it's recommended to use a different Nintendo account than the one
you play Animal Crossing on normally, so that the API can be used while you're playing.

You'll also need to compile the xBRZ scaling library. Don't worry, it has no deps. Just run `make -C xbrz`.

### Obtaining your credentials

1. Use [Lockpick_RCM](https://github.com/shchmue/Lockpick_RCM/releases)
   to obtain your prod.keys file and copy it to ~/.switch/prod.keys.
2. In Hekate, make a full backup of your Switch's NAND.
3. Install [ninfs](https://github.com/ihaveamac/ninfs) and use this command to mount your backup:
   `mount_nandhac -S rawnand.bin.00 /path/to/mountpoint`
4. Copy PRODINFO.img from your mountpoint to somewhere safe.
5. Mount SYSTEM.img as a FAT32 filesystem.
6. Using [hactoolnet](https://github.com/Thealexbarney/LibHac/releases), extract the `save/8000000000000010`
   file from your SYSTEM.img mountpoint using the following command:
   `hactoolnet -t save --outdir 8000000000000010-extracted /path/to/system.img-mountpoint/save/8000000000000010`.
7. `8000000000000010-extracted/su/baas/<guid>.dat` contains your BAAS user ID and password (your GUID will differ).
   The following python code will extract it:

```py
with open('/path/to/<guid>.dat', 'rb') as f:
	f.seek(0x20)
	print('BAAS user ID:', hex(int.from_bytes(f.read(8), byteorder='little')))
	print('BAAS password:', f.read(40).decode('ascii'))
```

8. Use [nxdumptool](https://github.com/DarkMatterCore/nxdumptool/releases) to dump your AC:NH ticket.
   You must have the eShop version to proceed. Game cards are not supported. 
   Use nxdumptool to dump the base ticket (not the update ticket) for the game.
9. Install these FS patches on your switch in order to disable CA Verficiation. https://github.com/misson20000/exefs_patches/tree/master/atmosphere/exefs_patches/disable_ca_verification
10. Set up a web proxy such as Charles. Configure your Switch's network settings to proxy through your web proxying software.
11. In game, log on to the Custom Designs kiosk at the Able Sister's shop. Then intercept your Switch's request to https://api.hac.lp1.acbaa.srv.nintendo.net/api/v1/auth_token. The request body contains a msgpack encoded dictionary like this: `{'id': 1311768467445894639, 'password': '64 characters here'}`. This user ID and password goes in the config as `acnh-user-id` and `acnh-password`.
12. Edit config.toml according to the information and files you retrieved.

- xbrz/ is based on code provided by Zenju under the GPLv3 license. Some changes were made:
  - Added some `extern "C"` declarations to the functions I intended to call from python.
  - Removed some namespace use to avoid being mangled.
  - Replaced a template that was fucking braindead even for a C++ developer with a simple function that takes two arguments.
    Was that so hard?
  - Converted the library to use RGBA instead of ARGB because Pillow only supports the former.
